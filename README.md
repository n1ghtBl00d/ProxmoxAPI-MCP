# ProxmoxAPI-MCP

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation for interacting with the Proxmox Virtual Environment API, built using the proxmoxer Python library.

## Overview

ProxmoxAPI-MCP provides a standardized interface to interact with Proxmox VE through the MCP protocol, making it easier to manage and control your Proxmox infrastructure programmatically.

## Features

- MCP-compliant server implementation
- Seamless integration with Proxmox VE using proxmoxer
- Simplified API interactions for common Proxmox operations
- Standardized communication protocol

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- proxmoxer library
- Access to a Proxmox VE server

## Installation
